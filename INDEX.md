# This is my Heading 01 from Week 02

This is an early foray into learning more about Latin American writers with materials held in Princeton University Library Special and Distinct Collections. The project began with  a list of collections  (and their linked finding aids) produced in a research guide by Fernando Acosta-Rodríguez, Librarian for Latin American, Iberian and Latino Studies at Princeton University.

This is an early foray into learning more about Latin American writers with materials held in Princeton University Library Special and Distinct Collections. The project began with  a list of collections  (and their linked finding aids) produced in a research guide by Fernando Acosta-Rodríguez, Librarian for Latin American, Iberian and Latino Studies at Princeton University. 

Rather than beginning this project with a deep dive into the archives, I decided to experiment with building a new corpus by starting with author names listed in the collection title and then linking these information from Wikidata to those names. What resulted was a small, yet useful dataset with demographic information about some of the Latin American writers present in the archives here..
